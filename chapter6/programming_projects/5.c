// Programming Project 1 in Chapter 4 asked you to write a program that displays a two-digit number with its digits reversed. Generalize the program so that the number can have one, two, three, or more digits. Hint: Use a do loop that repeatedly divides the number by 10, stopping when it reaches 0.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  int i;

  printf("Enter a two-digit number: ");
  scanf("%d", &i);

  printf("The reversal is: ");

  do 
  {
    printf("%d", i % 10);
    i /= 10;
  } while (i != 0);

  printf("\n");

  return 0;
}
